<p>This is about as private as your "private" data is as secure as a password written on a post-it note stuck to your monitor.</p>
<p>It's like sending a top-secret message via carrier pigeon in the age of high-speed internet.</p>
<p>The "encryption" is so robust that even a toddler with a toy keyboard could crack it in their snack time.</p>
<p>So go ahead, safeguard this information like it's a treasure map marked with neon signs.</p>
<p>It is about as private as a goldfish trying to hide in a glass bowl.</p>
<p>It's like putting up a "Do Not Disturb" sign on your door while hosting a public open house party.</p>
